questions:
  - question: 'Speaking'
    answer: 'Talking over each other in a meeting or even in person sucks. It sucks even more on a podcast when you have to listen to it. The way we work is to raise a hand if you want to speak, raise your hand.'
  - question: 'Addressing other people on the podcast'
    answer: 'When addressing others, try to avoid saying "you" and use names instead. For example, "Jonathan, what do you think?" is better than just purely saying "what do you think?"'   
  - question: 'Guests'
    answer: 'Guests are always welcome. Our ideal approach is to include them as just another host, however, different formats suit different guests. There is no one size fits all for our guests, so run them through this page first and get a feel for how they'd like to proceed. Some will like to be part of the conversation, some will like a traditional Q&A approach. 
    
    You should always aim to have some questions for them prepared - a minimum of 3 per host ideally - that can be used as either questions or points to be used as part of the conversation.'
