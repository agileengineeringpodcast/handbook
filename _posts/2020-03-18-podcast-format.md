questions:
  - question: 'Speaking'
    answer: 'Talking over each other in a meeting or even in person sucks. It sucks even more on a podcast when you have to listen to it. The way we work is to raise a hand if you want to speak, raise your hand.'
  - question: 'Addressing other people on the podcast'
    answer: 'When addressing others, try to avoid saying "you" and use names instead. For example, "Jonathan, what do you think?" is better than just purely saying "what do you think?"'
