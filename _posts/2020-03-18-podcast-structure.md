questions:
  - question: 'Cold open - <= 5 minutes'
    answer: 'Our hosts are always busy, speaking at various conferences, writing various articles and books as well as running events themselves. A cold open is the perfect place for this. Should sponsorship arise, this is where we will talk about that too. It should always be Liam or Liam + one other host, ideally recorded before or after the episode recording to reduce the amount to do in one session. We always end it with "Jonathan, roll the thing."'
  - question: 'Intro'
    answer: 'Our jazzy beats provided by <> run.'   
  - question: 'Welcome to the episode - <= 3 minutes'
    answer: 'A scripted open to the episode, usually done by Liam - see bottom of the page for scripts'   
  - question: 'Segment: Learnings between episodes - <= 15 minutes'
    answer: 'This is at present, our only regular segment. Up to 3 of the hosts, nominated ahead of the recording, talk about something new they have learned or a trend they have seen across the software industry.'   
  - question: 'Main topic - ~45 Minutes'
    answer: 'Our hosts discuss the main subject selected for this episode, along with our guest if present.'
  - question: 'Key takeaways - <= 10 minutes'
    answer: 'Following the main topic, our hosts discuss key takeaways from the discussion and provide a conclusion to the listener'
  - question: 'Scripted close - <= 2 minutes'
    answer: 'A scripted close to the episode, usually done by Liam, covering all the places listeners can join in the discussion and suggest topics.'    
  - question: 'Outro'
